# Baysian_Navigation
Position resection and intersection are methods to determine an unknown geographic position by measuring
angles with respect to known positions. In resection, the one point with unknown coordinates is occupied
and sightings are taken to the known points. This project will demonstrate how these methods work in
context of Bayesian Statistics.
